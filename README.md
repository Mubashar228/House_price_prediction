# 🏡 House Price Prediction - Machine Learning Project
I'm **Mubashar Ul Hassan**, a passionate Data Science learner and Python programmer.


Welcome to my Machine Learning project where I tried to predict house prices based on different features like number of bedrooms, area, and more. This is a simple regression-based ML model trained using Linear Regression in Python.

📌 About the Project

In today’s real estate market, pricing a house correctly is very important. So I built a basic ML model that learns from the dataset and can predict the price of a house based on certain features.

This project helped me understand:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building & training a regression model
- Evaluating model performance

 🧠 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (LinearRegression)
- Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project is a simple CSV file named `house_price.csv`, which contains the following columns:

- Area (in sq. ft)
- Bedrooms
- Bathrooms
- Stories
- Parking
- Mainroad Access
- Furnishing Status
- House Price (target)

 📊 Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted categorical data into numerical

2. EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)**
   - Checked distributions
   - Analyzed correlations
   - Created visual plots for better understanding

3. **Model Building**
   - Used Linear Regression to train the model
   - Split data into train-test sets
   - Evaluated using MSE & R2 Score

4. **Prediction**
   - Predicted house prices based on features
